How do you know something might be bad?
* Logging
* Alerting
* Tooling

What should you do with that information?
* Enrichments
* IOCs
* Threat Intel
* Correllation & exposure/other devices with same IOC

Now that you have context, what should you do next?
* How severe does it look?
* What is the appropriate next step (reporting up, ending the exposure, collecting evidence, getting answers, etc.)
