This assumes the following:

* You have some sort of virtual environment where you can deploy a few VMs
* You have access to deploy solutions on the company network & configure spans from core switches
* You have access to servers in the environment to deploy software
* You have access to endpoints in the environment to deploy software
* You have permission from the company to perform these actions

Some quick wins:
* Deploy graylog (start as a single node unless you have > ~1000 devices to manage)
    This should be a matter of deploying the OVA or docker container & having storage
        Configure a unique port for each input
        Configure a custom rule to move messages to different streams based on the inputs
        Configure a custom index for each stream
    Configure a winlogbeat, file beat, and/or nxlog config for each 
    Deploy wlb agents to each endpoint and confirm logs are being received

* Deploy SecurityOnion or Arkime in each network. Span the ingress/egress interfaces from the network to the solution

* Turn on essential logging features for systems (Group Policy; Sysmon, etc.)

* Deploy EDR & Endpoint Proteciton solutions

* Create an acceptable use policy

* Create an information security policy

* Run an asset discovery tool & export to a list periodically

* Create a risk register

* Create a fixed cadence & evidence collection system for periodic information security tasks

* Create an incident management/ticketing system

* Get a 'report phishing' button

* Set up a vulnerability scanner.
